                Varanasi, one of the world's oldest living cities, is rightly called the religious capital of India.
                Also known as Banaras or Benaras, this holy city is located in the southeastern part of the state of
                Uttar Pradesh in northern India. It rests on the left bank of the holy river Ganga (Ganges) and is one
                of the seven sacred spots for Hindus. Every devout Hindu hopes to visit the city at least once in a
                lifetime, take a holy dip at the Ghats of the Ganga (the famous steps leading down to the water), walk
                the pious Panchakosi road that bounds the city, and, if God wills, die here in old age
            </p>
            <h2>Varanasi for Visitors</h2>
            <p>Both Hindus and non-Hindus from around the world visit Varanasi for different reasons. Popularly called
                the city of Shiva and Ganga, Varanasi is simultaneously the city of temples, the city of ghats, the city
                of music, and the center for moksha, or nirvana.
            <p>
            <h3>What to expect</h3>
            <p>
                For every visitor, Varanasi has a different experience to offer. The gentle waters of the Ganges, the
                boat ride at sunrise, the high banks of the ancient ghats, the array of shrines, the meandering narrow
                serpentine alleys of the city, the myriad temple spires, the palaces at water's edge, the ashrams
                (hermitages), the pavilions, the chanting of mantras, the fragrance of incense, the palm and cane
                parasols, the devotional hymn—all offer a kind of mystifying experience that is unique to the city of
                Shiva.
                .</p>
            <p>
                When visitor Mark Twain visited Varanasi In 1897, he observed:

                ....older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of
                them put together.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>
                Arrival and orientation
            </h3>
            <p>
                Varanasi’s old city stretches back from the west bank of the Ganges in a maze of pedestrian alleys, or
                galis. This tight tangle of lanes can feel claustrophobic and crowded, but this is by far the most
                atmospheric part of the city. Indeed, things have changed here only superficially since medieval times.
                The old city spills out onto the west bank of the Ganges, and the riverbank is lined with more than 80
                ceremonial ghats, with central Dashashwamedh Ghat being the busiest and most famous. The east bank of
                the Ganges is a barren sandbank that floats in a misty haze created by the smoke from the endless
                cremation fires at Manikarnika.

            <h2> History of the City </h2>
            <p>
                Legends regarding the origin of Varanasi abound, but the archeological evidence suggests that urban
                settlement of the area began in about 2,000 BCE, making Varanasi one of the world's oldest continuously
                inhabited cities. In ancient times, the city was famous for its production of fine fabrics, perfumes,
                ivory works, and sculpture. Buddhism is said to have started here in 528 BCE in nearby Sarnath when the
                Buddha gave his lecture on the first turning of the Wheel of Dharma.</p>
            <p>
                By the 8th century CE, Varanasi had become a center for the worship of Shiva, and accounts from foreign
                travelers during the medieval period show that it had an unsurpassed reputation as a holy city.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the occupation by the Persian Empire in the 17th century, many of Varanasi's Hindu temples were
                destroyed and replaced with mosques, but in the 18th century, modern Varanasi began to take shape as
                Hindu-led governments facilitated the restoration of temples and the building of new shrines.
